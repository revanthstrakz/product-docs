While Google Docs has been a helpful tool for basic document creation and sharing, it falls short in many critical areas that are increasingly important for our work.</p><h2 id="format-rigidity-and-accessibility" tabindex="-1">Format Rigidity and Accessibility <a class="header-anchor" href="#format-rigidity-and-accessibility" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Format Rigidity and Accessibility&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Our documentation needs to be accessible and useful in various formats, from web pages to printed manuals to the local UI. However, Google Docs is fundamentally limited to a printable A4 page format. This makes it difficult to adapt our documentation for different purposes without significant reformatting. Moreover, as we look towards creating more dynamic and interactive documentation, the static nature of Google Docs becomes a limiting factor.</p><h2 id="synchronisation-problems" tabindex="-1">Synchronisation Problems <a class="header-anchor" href="#synchronisation-problems" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Synchronisation Problems&quot;">​</a></h2><p>One of the most significant challenges we&#39;ve faced with Google Docs is keeping our documentation synchronised across multiple revisions. As multiple team members edit documents, it can be challenging to ensure everyone is working from the latest version. This can lead to confusion, duplicated work, and inconsistencies.</p><h2 id="review-and-accuracy-challenges" tabindex="-1">Review and Accuracy Challenges <a class="header-anchor" href="#review-and-accuracy-challenges" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Review and Accuracy Challenges&quot;">​</a></h2><p>While Google Docs allows for comments and suggestions, the process for reviewing changes and ensuring the accuracy of our documentation can be cumbersome. It&#39;s often difficult to track who made which changes and why, especially when multiple reviewers are involved. This lack of clarity can compromise the quality and reliability of our documentation.</p><h2 id="version-control-limitations" tabindex="-1">Version Control Limitations <a class="header-anchor" href="#version-control-limitations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Version Control Limitations&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Google Docs does offer some version control through its &quot;Version History&quot; feature, but this is far from the robust version control systems used in software development. It&#39;s challenging to manage different versions of a document, compare changes between versions, or revert to a previous version without a lot of manual effort. For an organisation developing complex hardware and software solutions, and equally complex deployment processes, this level of version control is insufficient.</p><blockquote><p>The challenge: can we find a new solution that can grow with us and better support our mission?</p></blockquote>',11),n=[s];function r(c,l,u,d,h,m){return t(),o("div",null,n)}const p=e(i,[["render",r]]);export{g as __pageData,p as default};

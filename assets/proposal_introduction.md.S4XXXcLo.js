This document introduces the new documentation system, which builds on the power of Markdown and GitHub.</p><h2 id="purpose" tabindex="-1">Purpose <a class="header-anchor" href="#purpose" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Purpose&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The purpose of this document is to introduce a structured and efficient approach to handling our project documentation. Our aim is to move away from our current system, which, while familiar, presents several challenges (that we&#39;ve encountered!) that hinder our productivity and the quality of our work. By adopting Markdown and GitHub, we&#39;re adopting a workflow that enhances collaboration, flexibility and the integrity of our documentation over time.</p><h2 id="rationale" tabindex="-1">Rationale <a class="header-anchor" href="#rationale" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Rationale&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Our existing system, based on Google Docs, has served us well to a point. However, as we scale and our products become more complex, the limitations of this system have and will become increasingly apparent: such as issues with accessibility, version control, document synchronisation, and the rigidity of the printable page format.</p><h2 id="outcomes" tabindex="-1">Outcomes <a class="header-anchor" href="#outcomes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Outcomes&quot;">​</a></h2><p>By moving to Markdown for our core written content creation and GitHub for hosting and collaboration, we anticipate a multitude of benefits:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Flexibility and Accessibility</strong>: The ability to easily convert our documentation into various formats (PDF, HTML, etc.), making it accessible across different platforms and to different audiences.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enhanced Collaboration</strong>: Structured collaboration across our team, with tools designed for reviewing, discussing, and merging changes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improved Version Control</strong>: A robust system to track changes, manage versions, and revert to previous states if necessary, ensuring that our documentation remains current and accurate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Alignment with Open-Source Principles</strong>: We&#39;re an organisation committed to open-source and these are some of the most celebrated open source test-editing tools!</p></li></ul><p>This transition can enhance our capability to deliver impactful and reliable documentation that supports our mission to connect and empower marginalised communities worldwide.</p><p>Let&#39;s go!</p>',12),r=[i];function s(c,d,u,l,p,h){return t(),o("div",null,r)}const f=e(a,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,f as default};
